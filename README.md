# K8s Deployment Practice

This repo was a way to practice deploying to kubernetes and not much more. Don't expect any coding gems here.

There's a couple of image building scripts, a hello world app, and a deployment kustomization.

Yes, I hardcoded the image name and target namespace into the deployment and build scripts. Interpolating environment variables into YAML manifests is not what I'm practicing right now.
